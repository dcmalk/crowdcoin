# CrowdCoin

CrowdCoin is an example dApp for crowdfunding campaigns on Ethereum. The project uses a React-based frontend (Next.js) for interacting with an updated version of the [eth-kickstart](https://github.com/dcmalk/eth-kickstart) contract (Solidity).

In this project, users are able to create a campaign with a minimum contribution amount. Information about that campaign, including the current balance, number of contributors and pending request details can be viewed on the frontend. A manager can then finalize a request for payout. This request will only execute if approved by the majority of contributors.

Based on the Stephen Grider's course, [Ethereum and Solidity: The Complete Developer's Guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/ethereum-and-solidity-the-complete-developers-guide/).
